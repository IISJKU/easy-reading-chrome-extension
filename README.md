### Installation:
 Usage for the chrome extension: 
    
    1. Go to chrome://extensions/ 

    2. enable developer mode 
    
    3. load the folder 'EzReader' 
    

    4. How to use the client:

    Click on Debug ==> pick the server you wish to use(production/debug/local)  ==> click apply changes ==> click Login on the popup


     Important! the client doesn't automatically login. you need to click on Login on the popup. I can of course easily change that if that's inconvinent for someone.
